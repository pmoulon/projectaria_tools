## Multi-person Synchronization

This tutorial will walk you through the steps to get synchronized ground truth data in a multi-person sequence.

### How does time synchronization work in ADT
In a single-person ADT sequence, all ground truth data is stored in the [device capture time](/docs/data_formats/aria_vrs/timestamps_in_aria_vrs#time-code-timestamp) of the Aria used by the person.
For a multi-person ADT sequence, we store ground truth files in two separate folders, each representing a person's Aria recording. Each subsequence is self-contained such that all ground truth data is also
stored in the device capture time domain of the associated Aria device. To synchronize the two Aria devices, we store a mapping between [timecode](/docs/data_formats/aria_vrs/timestamps_in_aria_vrs#time-code-timestamp)
timestamps and device capture timestamps in each Aria data.


### Step 0 : Install project_aria_tools package and create venv if not already done

Follow Step 0 to Step 3 in [Getting Started](/docs/open_datasets/aria_digital_twin_dataset/getting_started).

### Step 1 : Prepare download

Follow Step 1 to Step 3 in [Download the sample Aria Digital Twin (ADT) sequence](/docs/open_datasets/aria_digital_twin_dataset/dataset_download#download-the-sample-aria-digital-twin-adt-sequence)

### Step 2 : Download sample multi-person sequence

From your python virtual environment, run:

```bash
adt_benchmark_dataset_downloader -c $HOME/Documents/projectaria_tools_adt_data/aria_digital_twin_dataset_download_urls.json \
-o $HOME/Documents/projectaria_tools_adt_data/ -l Apartment_release_multiskeleton_party_seq114 \
-d 0
```

### Step 3 : Run the tutorial notebook

From your python virtual environment, run:

```
cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox

jupyter notebook projectaria_tools/projects/AriaDigitalTwinDatasetTools/examples/adt_multiperson_tutorial.ipynb
```

## Troubleshooting

Check the [troubleshooting](/docs/data_utilities/installation/troubleshooting) if you are having issues in this guide.
