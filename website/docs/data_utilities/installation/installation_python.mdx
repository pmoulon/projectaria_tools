# How to Install the Python Package for Project Aria Tools

This page provides information about how to install the Python utilities using a virtual environment or from source. We recommend that only advanced users install from source.

Go to the [Python Type Annotation page](/docs/data_utilities/installation/type_hinting) for how to enable type hinting.

## Install via virtual environment
### Step 1 : Install Python

To use projectaria_tools and its Jupyter notebooks, you'll need Python 3.9 or above (3.10 if you are on [Apple Silicon](https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943)). To ensure all utilities work effectively, we recommend keeping Python 3 up to date.
* [Python 3 download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* To check what what version of Python 3 you have use `python3 --version`

### Step 2 : Create a virtual environment

```bash
rm -rf $HOME/projectaria_tools_python_env

python3 -m venv $HOME/projectaria_tools_python_env

source $HOME/projectaria_tools_python_env/bin/activate
```

###  Step 3 : Install the required Python packages

```bash
python3 -m pip --upgrade pip

python3 -m pip install projectaria-tools'[all]'
```
### Step 4 : Use Project Aria Tools
A few resources are:
* [Getting Started with Project Aria Data Utilities](../getting_started.mdx) - Python Tutorial
* [Request Machine Perception Services](/ARK/mps/request_mps/mps_cli_getting_started.mdx) - for Research Partners


:::tip Python Module Error?
Check the [Python module import error](/docs/data_utilities/installation/troubleshooting#python-module-import-error) section of [Data Utilities Troubleshooting Guide](/docs/data_utilities/installation/troubleshooting) if you encounter this issue

## Building Python bindings from source (advanced user)
You'll need to install C++ dependencies to build Python bindings from source.

1. Go to the [C++ Installation page](/docs/data_utilities/installation/installation_cpp) and follow the instructions to [install dependencies](/docs/data_utilities/installation/installation_cpp)
2. Go to the projectaria_tools code folder
3. Enter the following commands
```bash
cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox/projectaria_tools

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

python3 -m pip install .
```

:::info
For multithread build use the following:
- `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=4 pip3 install .`

If you encounter error during the build process like `ERROR: No matching distribution found for library X`:
- Double check that you are using the right pip, or Python version and then use `python -m pip install .` or `python3 -m pip install .`

## Generate and install type hinting from source (advanced user)
1. Install pybind11-stubgen to generate the stub files
2. Generate Python type hinting with generate_stubs.py script once projectaria_tools package is installed
3. Install type hinting package for projectaria_tools
```bash
python3 -m pip install pybind11-stubgen==1.1

cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox/projectaria_tools
python3 generate_stubs.py
cp -r projectaria_tools-stubs/projectaria_tools .
python3 -m pip install .
```
